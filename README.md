# GPUTrials
Trials with GPUImage library in Objective-C for iOS

Initial commit is a follow along from http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-photo-app-with-gpuimage--mobile-12223 and adapted for iOS 9

This version has options to choose a photo from albums or take a photo and then apply a set of filters to it and save it back to albums. 

Roadmap planned for
 - Have a better UI - Show a collectionview or a new interaction for available filters.
 - Explore every possible image manipulation possible with GPUImage.
 - Proceed to videos, video filters
